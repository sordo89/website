          <p>I just enjoy a good movie, or a well  played guitar song. Fashion is a way of thinking for me ,not only a way of dressing , I dont dress for people ,I dress for myself . I really care about  politics of our times but i won't tell anyone what to think , I have my own religion, which is no better than yours but it´s mine and should be respected as yours.My everyday starts with a coffee and I´m not proud of it but I love marlboros.I don't drink alchool because I simply don't like it anymore. My favorite  food is sushi but you can conquer me with a pizza . I love coke but I think water it's the best gift of life , everyone should have acces to clear water.I don't care too much about my phone instead of messages I prefer face to face converstions and nothing feels as good as a huge, cellphones only brings misscomunication problems.I believe that people should dream  that one day they'll become what they want, and allways dream bigger. the first step it's believe you can , then everything comes by itself. And i do think that the power of people is stronger than the people in power so never stop fighting and "kill them with kidness".
          p.s.: The best advice that somebody has gave me is : "do not give advices to anyone".
